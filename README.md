# makeover-monday-with-python
Personal submissions to the #MakeoverMonday project using python code

Makeover Monday is a weekly data visualization community project organized by Eva Murray and Andy Kriebel.  Its purpose is to help people develop their data visualization skills by providing participants with the chance to challenge themselves with a weekly dataset and learn from others in the process.  I recommend Makeover Monday who anyone who would like to develop their data visualization skills; more info can be found at http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/.

Although most Makeover Monday participants use Tableau to create their visualizations, the project itself welcomes submissions using any tool.  I believe it will accelerate my python learning experience to challenge myself to use python for at least five Makeover Monday submissions.  In the process, I'd like to document my exploration of various python visualization libraries.  My hope is that my code here could be useful for others trying to create visualizations in python.
